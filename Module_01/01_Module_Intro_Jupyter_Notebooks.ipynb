    "# Introduction to Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running code. The notebook is capable of running code in a wide range of langauges, however we will focus on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is loved by most data scientist for many reasons:\n",
    "1. <b>All In One Place</b>: Combines code, rich text, images, videos, animations, mathematical equations, plots, maps, interactive figures and widges, and graphical user interfaces, into a single document.\n",
    "2. <b>Easy To Convert/Share</b>: Comes with nbconvert, which converts notebooks to other formats such as HTML or PDF.\n",
    "3. <b>Language Independent</b>: Possible to write in any language.\n",
    "4. <b>Stress-Free Reproducible Experiments</b>: Conduct efficient and reproducible interactive computing experiments with ease.\n",
    "5. <b>Effective Teaching/Learning Tool</b>\n",
    "6. <b>Interactive Code & Data Exploration</b>: Provide a user interface controls for exploring code and data interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Jupyter as an advanced word processor. Take some time amd scroll through the lis tof commands from the command pallette, you can find it by checking out the small button with the keyboard icon (or `Ctrl + Shift + P`)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two terms you should become familiar with: cells and kernels are key to understanding Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
